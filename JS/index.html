            <li><strong>Project 1: Cloud Infrastructure Automation</strong> In this project, I designed and implemented
                an automated cloud infrastructure setup using Terraform and AWS. The project involved creating a
                scalable and secure environment for deploying microservices. I automated the provisioning of resources
                like EC2 instances, RDS databases, and VPCs, ensuring efficient and consistent infrastructure
                management. Additionally, I integrated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, enabling seamless
                deployment of updates with minimal downtime. </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Project 2: Web Application Development

                </strong> This project focused on developing a responsive and user-friendly web application using
                React.js and Node.js. I was responsible for both the frontend and backend development, creating a robust
                RESTful API for data management and a dynamic user interface for client interaction. The application
                featured real-time data updates using WebSockets and ensured data security through JWT authentication
                and role-based access control. The project was delivered with comprehensive unit and integration tests,
                ensuring high code quality and reliability.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Project 3: Data Analytics Platform

                </strong> In this project, I developed a data analytics platform using Python and Apache Spark. The
                platform was designed to process large datasets, perform complex analytics, and generate insightful
                reports. I implemented ETL pipelines to collect, clean, and transform data from various sources, making
                it ready for analysis. The platform also featured customizable dashboards built with Plotly and Dash,
                allowing users to visualize trends and patterns in real-time. This project significantly improved the
                decision-making process by providing actionable insights through data.
